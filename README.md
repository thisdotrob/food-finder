Food Finder
===

My first program written in Ruby - the 'Food Finder' project from Chapter 9 of the Lynda 'Ruby Essential Training' course by Kevin Skoglund:
http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-tutorials/essential-training/47905-2.html

The program allows a user to search and modify a list of restaurants. I decided to write my own version of the program before watching the walkthrough to enhance my learning.

Usage
---
The program reads in the list of restaurants and dishes from the restaurants.txt file.

To start, open terminal, browse to the root of the project and enter ```ruby init.rb```.

`list` can be used to show all the restaurants:

`find` can be combined with a dish type / restaurant name / price to filter the list of restaurants:

`add` takes the user through a series of prompts to add a restaurant to the file:
