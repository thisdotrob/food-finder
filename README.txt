Food Finder
-----------

Program written in Ruby which displays a list of restaurants and allows the user 
to search for one based on name, cuisine type or price. The user can add new restaurants, 
and the full list of restaurants is saved to a text file on quit. The same file is read 
each time the program starts.

This was my first program written in Ruby. This is the 'Food Finder' project from Chapter 9
of the Lynda 'Ruby Essential Training' online course. I watched the first video of that 
chapter to see the program in action to understand what it should do and how it should look,
then set about trying to implement it myself before watching any of the later videos which 
demonstrate how Lynda implemented it. I did it this way as I thought I'd learn more by 
attempting my own version first.
